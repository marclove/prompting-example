# S-Corp Expense Tracker Development Guide

This document outlines an iterative approach to building our S-Corp Expense Tracker MVP. The roadmap prioritizes critical features to create a functional product as quickly as possible. Our development approach follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.

## Instructions for LLM Coding Agent

### Development Process

For each Job To Be Done (JTBD) story:

1. **Write Tests First**: Create comprehensive unit and integration tests that validate all acceptance criteria.

2. **Implement Solution**: Write clean, maintainable code that passes all tests.

3. **Run Test Suite**: Execute the full test suite to ensure no regressions.

4. **Commit Changes**: Write a descriptive commit message following our convention:
   ```
   [JTBD-X] Brief title
   
   - Implemented feature details
   - Fixed related issues
   - Added specific components
   ```

5. **Request Review**: Stop after completing each JTBD and request human pair programmer review before proceeding.

### Development Best Practices

- Leverage the linter to maintain code quality standards
- Use the debugger with strategic breakpoints to troubleshoot complex issues
- Implement error handling for all user inputs and external interactions
- Keep components modular to support future extensions
- Consider mobile experience for all UI implementations
- Document any technical decisions that impact future phases

Begin with Phase 1 (Core Expense Capture) and proceed sequentially through each JTBD.

# S-Corp Expense Tracker: Jobs To Be Done (JTBD)

## Phase 1: Core Expense Capture

### JTBD-1: Record Basic Expense Information
**Title:** Log Business Expense
**Description:** As an S-corp owner, I want to quickly record my business expenses so I can track my spending and have proper documentation for tax purposes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can enter date, amount, vendor name, and select a basic category
- Form validates required fields before submission
- Submitted expense appears immediately in the expense list
- User receives confirmation when expense is successfully saved
- User can edit previously entered expenses
- Mobile and desktop interfaces both support expense entry

**Technical Note:** Implement client-side form validation to provide immediate feedback and reduce server load.

### JTBD-2: Capture Receipt Images
**Title:** Attach Receipt to Expense
**Description:** As an S-corp owner, I want to attach digital images of receipts to my expense records so I have proper documentation for tax audits.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can upload image files from their device
- Mobile users can directly capture photos using their device camera
- Images are compressed to reasonable file sizes without losing readability
- Receipts are viewable alongside expense details
- User can delete and replace receipt images if needed

**Technical Note:** Consider using client-side image compression before upload to improve performance and reduce storage costs.

### JTBD-3: View Expense History
**Title:** Browse Expense Records
**Description:** As an S-corp owner, I want to view my past expenses so I can review my spending history and find specific transactions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Expenses are displayed in a list format with key details visible
- List can be filtered by date range 
- User can sort expenses by date, amount, or vendor
- Tapping/clicking an expense shows full details and attached receipt
- User interface remains responsive even with hundreds of expense records

### JTBD-4: Secure Account Access
**Title:** Create and Access Account
**Description:** As an S-corp owner, I want to securely access my expense data across multiple devices so I can manage expenses anywhere.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can register with email and secure password
- User can log in from any device
- User can log out
- User can reset forgotten password
- Session times out after period of inactivity
- Only authenticated users can access expense data

**Technical Note:** Implement proper password hashing and consider offering 2FA in a future iteration.

### JTBD-5: Export Basic Data
**Title:** Download Expense Data
**Description:** As an S-corp owner, I want to export my expense data so I can share it with my accountant or import it into other financial systems.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can export expense data in CSV format
- Export includes all core expense details (date, amount, vendor, category)
- User can select a date range for the export
- Export process handles large data sets without timing out
- Downloaded file uses a clear naming convention including date range

## Phase 2: S-Corp Specific Functionality

### JTBD-6: Categorize with Tax-Aligned Categories
**Title:** Classify Expenses for Tax Purposes
**Description:** As an S-corp owner, I want to categorize expenses according to IRS-recognized categories so I can easily prepare my tax filings.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System provides pre-defined categories aligned with Schedule C and Form 1120-S
- Categories include common S-corp expenses (office supplies, travel, meals, etc.)
